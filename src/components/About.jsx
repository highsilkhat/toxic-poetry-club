            <p>We aspire to be constructively toxic— dissolving those barriers of institution, </p>
            <p>of limits, the things that would hold us back from speaking the truths of the universe— </p>
            <p>all while rejecting hate speech, racism, misogyny, transphobia and those tools used</p>
            <p>by oppressors everywhere out of fear of their own smallness.</p>
